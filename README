ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS
---------------------

3.2 What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value? What do we try to control on?
multiply certain level means the weight that we would like to give that level . this enables us
to control the gain each scale of details is getting so for example it would be possible to enhance
smaller details if larger coefficient is applied to the lower levels, while larger scale details can 
be enhanced in the opposite manner (i.e give larger coefficient to higher levels).
